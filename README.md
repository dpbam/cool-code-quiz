**Welcome to Cool Code Quiz**

## Cool Code Quiz is a website that uses JavaScript logic, HTML, and CSS to create a multiple choice Javascript quiz with a place the user can input their initials and a highscore page. When the user picks a wrong answer, as a penalty the timer will be reduced by 10 seconds. At the end of the game, the user's score is how much time is left on the clock.

### This was an extremely difficult Challenge. I had trouble at each stage of completing this project.

##### for help I used W3 Schools, Google, StackOverflow, YouTube, TAs, my tutor, my neighbor, my 3 year old son, and a shaman that could've been a homeless guy.
